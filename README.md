Auto LinkedIn - View LinkedIn Profiles Quickly
================================
Java Maven project (which uses Selenium) to allow you to view a huge amount of LinkedIn profiles with very little effort!


Er...why?
--------------------------

When I just left college years ago and out looking for jobs, one of the tricks I'd do is view recruiter's profiles on LinkedIn of companies that I had an interest in. LinkedIn then notifies them that I viewed their profile and now and again they'd also check out your profile (and maybe send you a message!).

Recruiters send out spammy messages to developers all the time, so now it's our time to be sneaky.


How to use it
--------------------------

* Firstly, you'll need [Chrome Driver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)

* In Constants.java point the Chrome Driver path to wherever your driver is on your machine

* In the test class, change the email address and password to be whatever user you want to log in as to LinkedIn (Make sure you don't commit this to any repo)

* In the test class again, change the list of search terms to be whatever type of LinkedIn users that you're interested in
